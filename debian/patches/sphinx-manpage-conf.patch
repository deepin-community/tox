+===
+
+Synopsis
+--------
+
+**tox** [*subcommand*] [*options*] [*args* ...]
+
+Description
+-----------
+
+tox is a generic virtual environment management and test command line tool you can use for:
+
+* checking your package builds and installs correctly under different environments (such as different Python
+  implementations, versions or installation dependencies),
+* running your tests in each of the environments with the test tool of choice,
+* acting as a frontend to continuous integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and
+  shell-based testing.
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+tox has several subcommands, each with their own options. Below you can find an
+exhaustive list of options for each of those subcommands.
+
+Each tox subcommand has a 1 (or 2) letter shortcut form too. For example, `tox
+run` can also be written as `tox r` or `tox config` can be shortened to `tox
+c`.
+
+Options
+-------

+  :module: tox.config.cli.parse
+  :func: _get_parser_doc
