tox (3.28.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a dependency on python3-tomli to fix runtime failures when running
    under Python versions earlier than 3.11. This was in setup.cfg as a
    complex environment marker that pydist could not parse.

tox (3.28.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, from the legacy 3.x branch.
  * Update debian/watch to point to tarballs from GitHub, as these are more
    complete nowadays.
  * Use SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION to fix the setuptools_scm version, and
    to avoid the version being set based on the git tag.
  * Drop patch disable-setuptools-scm: instead of patching setup.py to disable
    setuptools_scm, use it, but set SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION to instruct
    it to not fetch the version from git, but rather set it statically to
    DEB_VERSION_UPSTREAM.
  * Add support for the nodoc build option and profile.
  * towncrier now exists in Debian, so use it instead of faking it with our
    own "faketowncrier" version. It still does not serve any purpose in the
    package, but helps with avoiding any drift with upstream. Add patch
    "towncrier-build" to fix an issue with how tox invokes it right now.
  * Various package hygiene cleanups:
    - Add a gbp.conf file to always enable pristine-tar and to switch to the
      new style (*/latest) DEP-14 branch structure.
    - Add debian/source/options to extend-diff-ignore the "egg-info"
      directory which tends to be uselessly dirty.
    - Use the more declarative debian/clean file instead of an dh_auto_clean
      override.
    - Use execute_after_dh_auto_build instead of override_, given we were not
      really overriding.
    - Use dh-sequence-python3 and dh-sequence-sphinxdoc, instead of passing
      --with to dh.
    - Update Homepage with the new tox.wiki website.
    - Add debian/upstream/metadata.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 4.6.2, no changes needed.
