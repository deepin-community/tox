tox (4.4.6-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New major upstream release.
    - Adjust to the new buildsystem, hatchling in the place of setuptools.
    - Remove removed file src/tox/_quickstart.py from debian/copyright.
    - Remove patch alabaster-no-external-links, alabaster is not used anymore.
    - Add patch docs-remove-shields-io-badges to remove badges that reference
      third-party web resources.
    - Drop patch towncrier-build, included in new upstream.
    - Drop _draft.rst.txt removal, not necessary with new upstream and with
      the real towncrier.
    - Add patch relax-dependencies, to relax the dependency on platformdirs to
      the version currently in Debian (2.6.2 -> 2.6.0).
  * Remove our handwritten manpage, and generate the manpage from the
    project's documentation instead. Add patch sphinx-manpage-conf to generate
    the template for it.
  * Add extend-diff-ignore to debian/source/options to exclude the Python egg
    (egg-info) and thus build twice from source with no warnings.
  * Drop python3-tomli and python3-toml build and runtime dependencies, in
    favor of requiring Python 3.11, which is the default version in Debian.
  * Add patch intersphinx-mapping-local to resolve Python intersphinx
    dependencies using the local objects.inv copy.

 -- Faidon Liambotis <paravoid@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Feb 2023 22:54:12 +0200

tox (3.28.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a dependency on python3-tomli to fix runtime failures when running
    under Python versions earlier than 3.11. This was in setup.cfg as a
    complex environment marker that pydist could not parse.

 -- Faidon Liambotis <paravoid@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jan 2023 18:54:22 +0200

tox (3.28.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, from the legacy 3.x branch.
  * Update debian/watch to point to tarballs from GitHub, as these are more
    complete nowadays.
  * Use SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION to fix the setuptools_scm version, and
    to avoid the version being set based on the git tag.
  * Drop patch disable-setuptools-scm: instead of patching setup.py to disable
    setuptools_scm, use it, but set SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION to instruct
    it to not fetch the version from git, but rather set it statically to
    DEB_VERSION_UPSTREAM.
  * Add support for the nodoc build option and profile.
  * towncrier now exists in Debian, so use it instead of faking it with our
    own "faketowncrier" version. It still does not serve any purpose in the
    package, but helps with avoiding any drift with upstream. Add patch
    "towncrier-build" to fix an issue with how tox invokes it right now.
  * Various package hygiene cleanups:
    - Add a gbp.conf file to always enable pristine-tar and to switch to the
      new style (*/latest) DEP-14 branch structure.
    - Add debian/source/options to extend-diff-ignore the "egg-info"
      directory which tends to be uselessly dirty.
    - Use the more declarative debian/clean file instead of an dh_auto_clean
      override.
    - Use execute_after_dh_auto_build instead of override_, given we were not
      really overriding.
    - Use dh-sequence-python3 and dh-sequence-sphinxdoc, instead of passing
      --with to dh.
    - Update Homepage with the new tox.wiki website.
    - Add debian/upstream/metadata.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 4.6.2, no changes needed.
